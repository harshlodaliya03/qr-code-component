# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## 📄 Overview

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). The goal was to create a simple, responsive card component using HTML and CSS that displays a QR code with a call-to-action message.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, Flexbox)
- Google Fonts (`Outfit`)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Box-shadow, border-radius for modern card styling

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to build a clean, centered card layout using **Flexbox**
- How to use **`max-width`**, **relative units (`%`, `rem`)**, and **padding** to ensure responsiveness
- Improved understanding of how to structure small reusable UI components with semantic markup
- Better design matching by referencing **design previews**

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- Centering the card vertically on all devices without using media queries
- Keeping image proportions intact while scaling responsively
- Ensuring spacing looked balanced across various screen sizes

---

## ❓ Areas I’d Like Feedback On

- Suggestions to improve the responsiveness further without media queries
- Whether my card layout and scaling approach is optimal for similar components
- Any improvements in HTML semantics or CSS structure
